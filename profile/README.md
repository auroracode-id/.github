## About

Aurora.code was formed by software engineering students from SMKN 1 Boyolangu (RPL).  
We collaborate as a small team with clearly defined roles:

- UI/UX Designer  
- Front-End Developer  
- Back-End Developer  
- Security Engineer 

Our goal is not just to build websites, but to design digital systems that solve real problems.

- Company profile websites  
- E-commerce platforms  
- Custom web applications  
- UI/UX design systems

## How We Work

We apply a structured development workflow:

1. Requirement analysis  
2. UI/UX design  
3. Development  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  

This ensures every project is maintainable, scalable, and production-ready.

## Philosophy

We believe good software is not defined by how many features it has,  
but by how clearly the system is designed.

Code should be:
- Readable  
- Secure  
- Purpose-driven
